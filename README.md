# Jana's Shopping Cart

## Project's Scope

- The scope of this project was to build **my third application in React using react-router-dom**.
- Using Router, I created a SPA Sushi Restaurant (Shopping Cart/Order Online).

## Getting Started

cd shopping-cart
npm install
npm start
```

## Project Details & Description

- This is a SPA (Single Page Application) made with React Router.
- In this shop, we have a list of products and a cart. In the Navigation Bar you can see how many items are in the cart(if any).
- You can click once on + or - to add or remove single cart items, or you can input custom in addition to what you have in the cart.
- On the Cart page, you can modify the quantity of each element, remove entirely, see the total costs.
- On the Store page, if you press the minus button when you only have 1 item of that type in the cart, it will remove it entirely from the cart.
- If you press on the minus button with 0 items in the cart, nothing will happen.
- On the Contact Page I currently added some conditional rendering and more use of state and passed props.
